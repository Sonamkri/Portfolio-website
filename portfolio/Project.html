    <h2>AI Resume Ranker</h2>
    <p>
      Developed the frontend design for an AI-powered Resume Ranker application that helps recruiters evaluate resumes efficiently. The tool uses natural language processing to parse and analyze candidate profiles and scores their job fit based on specific job descriptions. By building a user-friendly interface with HTML and CSS, the design ensures clarity and usability. This project significantly improves the recruitment process by reducing manual screening time and delivering accurate candidate recommendations through a well-structured layout.

    <h2>Diabetes Predictor using Machine Learning</h2>
    <p>
      This project aims to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on various health-related metrics. It uses machine learning techniques trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset to provide predictive analysis. The system includes data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation using algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest. Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn were used. A user-friendly web interface was built using Streamlit to allow real-time predictions. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy scores, confusion matrix, and ROC curves.
